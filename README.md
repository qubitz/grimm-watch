  2. **Configure**
    Change the *Active Scheme* of the Xcode project to 'Grimm WatchKit App'

  3. **Play**
    Hit the play button (triangle next to the square) in the top left corner of Xcode. From here it will load up an iPhone and Apple Watch simulator. I've found that you have to let the simulators boot, start the watch app manually, and then hit play on Xcode again, but that could just be me.
